## Download_Avast Free Antivirus Free Antivirus for Windows 2025

Avast One employs the company’s top-notch antivirus engines that can perform various device scans—Smart Scan, Targeted Scan, Deep Scan, and Boot-Time Scan. A Smart Scan is the quick examination of your system for malware, suspicious browser add-ons, and PC performance issues that can run about 10 to 15 seconds. The Targeted Scan, on the other hand, enables you to scrutinize specific files or folders while the Deep Scan checks your entire system. Lastly, before your Windows system fully starts, you can set the Boot-Time Scan.
